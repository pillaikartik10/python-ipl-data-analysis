## The Project  
  
The Indian Premier League(IPL) is an annual T-20 cricket league held primarily in India. Attracting the world's best cricketers, it is the sport's premier domestic league competition. Here we take an existing dataset on IPL, and try and analysis it.  
  
The available dataset gives us basic information about the 816 IPL matches held between 2008 - 2020, like the teams involved in each match, the toss winner, the toss decision, venue, eventual winner, the manner of victory etc.  
   
We attempt to find out the following :  
  
1. The number of matches played each season.
2. The number of wins per each team, and their win %.
3. Which was the more popular choice for the toss winner - batting or fielding? And how did winning the toss influence the chances of winning the game?
4. Who are more successful - teams batting first, or teams batting second?
5. Dividing the wins per each team into victories after batting first, and victories after batting second. Is there any pattern between the two? Are there teams who are significantly better in one scenario than the other?
6. Analysing Player of The Match winners.  

The results are present in static form [here](https://github.com/pillaikartik10/python-ipl-data-analysis/blob/main/ipl_analysis.ipynb). You can find the interactive version on Binder [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pillaikartik10/python-ipl-data-analysis/main?filepath=ipl_analysis.ipynb).
